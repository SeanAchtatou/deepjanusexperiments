# Experimental Data and Scripts for DLFuzz #

The folder __exp-DLF-FSE__ contains the data resulting from the experimental procedure described in the paper.

The metrics can be computed by running the python script __evaluation_radius_DLF.py__ provided in this folder. 

The output of these scripts is a csv file containing the data reported in the paper. The expected output is reported in Table3-DLF.csv.

## How to Obtain DLFuzz ##
DLFuzz is the tool proposed in the paper _DLFuzz: differential fuzzing testing of deep learning systems_ by J. Guo et al.
The code can be obtained from https://github.com/turned2670/DLFuzz.
