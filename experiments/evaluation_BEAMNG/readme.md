# Experimental Data and Scripts for BeamNG #

The folder __experiments-BEAMNG-FSE__ contains the data resulting from the experimental procedure described in the paper.

The metrics can be computed by running the python scripts __evaluation_radius.py__ and __evaluation_curvature.py__ provided in this folder. 

The output of these scripts are csv files containing the data reported in the paper. 
The expected output is reported in the files Table2_curvature.csv, Table2_curvatures_raw.csv, Table3_BeamNG_radius_in.csv, and Table3_BeamNG_radius_out.csv.
